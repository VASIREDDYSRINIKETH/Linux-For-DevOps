# How to Enable Password Authentication in AWS EC2 Instances

This guide will walk you through the steps to enable password authentication for SSH access on your AWS EC2 instances.

## Prerequisites

- An AWS account with access to EC2 instances.
- Basic understanding of AWS EC2 and SSH.

## Steps

1. **Launch your EC2 Instance**
   - Launch an EC2 instance as usual from the AWS Management Console.

2. **Connect to your Instance**
   - Use SSH to connect to your instance:

     ```bash
     ssh -i <path_to_your_key_file> ec2-user@<public_dns_name>
     ```

3. **Enable Password Authentication**
   - Edit the SSH configuration file:

     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
     ```

   - Find the line `PasswordAuthentication no` and change it to `PasswordAuthentication yes`.
   - Save and exit the file (`Ctrl + X`, then `Y`, then `Enter`).

4. **Restart SSH Service**
   - Restart the SSH service for changes to take effect:

     ```bash
     sudo service sshd restart
     ```

5. **Set a Password**
   - Set a password for the `ec2-user`:

     ```bash
     sudo passwd ec2-user
     ```

   - Enter and confirm the new password when prompted.

6. **Access EC2 Instance with Password**
   - Now you can SSH into your instance using password authentication:

     ```bash
     ssh ec2-user@<public_dns_name>
     ```

   - Enter the password you set earlier when prompted.

7. **Important Security Note**
   - Password authentication introduces security risks. Ensure strong passwords and consider other security measures such as using SSH keys or security groups.

## Conclusion

You have successfully enabled password authentication on your AWS EC2 instance. Remember to follow best security practices to keep your instance secure.
