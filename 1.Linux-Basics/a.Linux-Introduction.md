# Linux Introduction

## 1. What is Linux?

- Linux is a Unix-based operating system introduced by Linus Torvalds in 1991.
- It is open-source and low cost.
- Linux is free to use and is based on the Linux kernel.

## 2. What is Linux Kernel?

- The Linux kernel is the main component of a Linux operating system and acts as the core interface between a computerâ€™s hardware and its processes.
- The kernel performs four main jobs:
  - Memory management: Tracks memory usage and allocation.
  - Process management: Controls CPU usage by processes.
  - Device drivers: Mediates between hardware and processes.
  - System calls and security: Handles service requests and ensures system security.

## 3. What are the Core Components of Linux?

- **Kernel:** Manages system resources directly and provides essential services like process management, memory management, and device drivers.
- **System Library:** Provides common functionality to applications and abstracts low-level hardware interactions.
- **System Utility:** Command-line tools for system management, file operations, text processing, and administrative functions.
- **Shell:** Command-line interpreter for interacting with the OS.
- **Hardware:** Physical components of a computer system.

## 4. Difference between Linux and Unix

| Aspect               | Linux                                      | Unix                                      |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Development & Licensing | Developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991. Open-source with various distributions under licenses like GPL. | Originated in the late 1960s at AT&T Bell Labs. Initially proprietary, later standardized. Often requires licensing fees. |
| Kernel               | Linux kernel, developed independently of Unix. | Based on various Unix kernels such as the original Unix kernel or BSD. |
| Distribution Model   | Distributed in various distributions (distros) by different organizations and communities. | Typically distributed by vendors such as IBM, Sun Microsystems, HP, etc. |
| Community & Ecosystem | Large and diverse community of developers and users worldwide. Vibrant open-source community. | Historically associated with commercial vendors, with smaller open-source communities. |
| Compatibility & Standards | Adheres to POSIX standards and aims for compatibility with Unix standards. May introduce its own features. | Adheres to various standards like POSIX, but differences in implementation between Unix variants may exist. |
| Examples             | Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, CentOS, Arch Linux, etc. | Various proprietary Unix variants and open-source Unix-like systems like FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc. |

## 5. What is Bash?

- Bash, short for "Bourne Again Shell," is a widely used Unix shell and command-line interpreter.
- It was invented by Brian Fox in 1989 and further developed by Chet Ramey.
- Bash is the default shell on most Linux distributions and is available on macOS and other Unix-like systems.

## 6. Features of Linux

- Portable Environment
- Free and Open-source
- Shell/Command Line Interface
- End-to-end Encryption
- Lightweight Infrastructures
- Flexibility

## 7. What are Daemons?

- In Linux, daemons are background processes that run independently, performing various system tasks or providing services.
- Examples include the Apache web server, SSH daemon, and cron daemon.

## 8. Linux File System Hierarchy

- **Root Directory (/):** Top-level directory in the Linux file system hierarchy.
- **/bin:** Essential command binaries.
- **/boot:** Boot loader files and kernel images.
- **/dev:** Device files.
- **/etc:** Configuration files.
- **/home:** User home directories.
- **/lib and /lib64:** Shared libraries.
- **/mnt and /media:** Mount points for temporary file systems.
- **/opt:** Optional software packages.
- **/proc:** Process information.
- **/root:** Root user's home directory.
- **/sbin:** System binaries.
- **/tmp:** Temporary files.
- **/usr:** User programs and data.
- **/var:** Variable data.
