# Disck Management

Disk management refers to the process of managing disk storage resources in a computer system. This includes tasks such as partitioning disks, formatting file systems, assigning drive letters or mount points, managing disk quotas, and monitoring disk usage and performance.

## Here are some key aspects of disk management:

1.`Partitioning`: Dividing a physical disk into separate sections known as partitions. Each partition can then be formatted with a file system and used to store data independently. Partitioning enables users to organize their disk space and separate different types of data.

2.`Formatting`: After partitioning, each partition needs to be formatted with a file system that dictates how data is stored and accessed. Common file systems include NTFS (used in Windows), ext4 (used in Linux), and APFS (used in macOS).

3.`Mounting`: In operating systems like Linux and macOS, partitions need to be mounted to a directory in the file system hierarchy before they can be accessed. This process assigns a mount point to the partition, allowing users to interact with its contents.

4.`Drive Letters`: In Windows systems, each partition is assigned a unique drive letter (such as C:, D:, etc.) to facilitate easy access. Drive letters are used to identify and access different storage volumes.

5.`Disk Quotas`: Disk quotas allow administrators to limit the amount of disk space users or groups can consume on a file system. This helps in managing disk usage and preventing users from exhausting available storage resources.

6.`Monitoring and Maintenance`: Disk management also involves monitoring disk usage, performance, and health. This includes tasks like checking disk space utilization, monitoring disk read/write speeds, and detecting disk errors or failures.
