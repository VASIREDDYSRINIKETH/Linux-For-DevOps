# Understanding the `cut` Command

## Introduction

The `cut` command is a powerful tool used to extract parts of each line from a file. It offers various options for cutting based on byte position, character position, and fields delimited by a specified character (by default, the delimiter is the tab). This README provides an overview of the `cut` command syntax, options, and usage examples.

## Basic Syntax

The basic syntax for the `cut` command is as follows:

```
cut [options] <positions/fields or range of positions/fields> <input_file>
```


Additional usage examples include:

- `cat file | cut [options] <positions/fields or range of positions/fields>`

## Options

| Option | Description                            |
|--------|----------------------------------------|
| `-b`   | Specify byte positions                |
| `-c`   | Specify character positions           |
| `-f`   | Specify field positions               |

## Ranges

Ranges can be specified in the following formats:

- Single position: `2` (only the second byte/character/field)
- Range: `2-` (from the second byte/character/field to the last)
- Range: `-7` (from the first to the seventh)
- Multiple positions: `3,5` (the third and fifth)
- Multiple ranges: `3-7, 6-10` (from the third to the seventh and from the sixth to the tenth)

## Usage Examples

### Cut Command for Byte/Character Position

To cut out a section of a line by specifying a byte/character position, use the `-b` or `-c` option.

| Example Command     | Description                                           |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `cut -b 2 mytext.txt` | Extracts the second byte from each line of `mytext.txt` |
| `cut -b 3,7 mytext.txt` | Extracts the third and seventh bytes from each line     |
| `cut -b 5-9 mytext.txt` | Extracts bytes 5 through 9 from each line               |
| `cut -b 5- mytext.txt`  | Extracts bytes 5 to the end of each line                |
| `cut -b -7,9 mytext.txt`| Extracts bytes from the beginning to the 7th, and the 9th byte|

### Cut Command for Field Position

To cut out a section of a line by specifying a field position, use the `-f` option.

| Example Command     | Description                                           |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `cut -f 2 mytext.txt` | Extracts the second field from each line of `mytext.txt` |
| `cut -f 3,7 mytext.txt` | Extracts the third and seventh fields from each line     |
| `cut -f 5-9 mytext.txt` | Extracts fields 5 through 9 from each line               |
| `cut -f 5- mytext.txt`  | Extracts fields 5 to the end of each line                |
| `cut -f -7,9 --output-delimiter=" " mytext.txt` | Extracts fields from the beginning to the 7th, and the 9th field, using space as the output delimiter|


Use -s option with â€“f to Ignore the line that do not contain a delimiter
